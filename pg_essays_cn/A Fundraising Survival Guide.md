2008年8月  
  
融资是创立初创公司过程中第二困难的部分。最困难的是创造出人们真正需要的东西：大多数失败的初创公司都死于此因。而第二大死因很可能就是融资的艰难。融资过程极其残酷。  
  
这种残酷部分源于市场本身的冷酷无情。那些大部分时间生活在学校或大公司里的人可能从未体验过这一点。教授和上司通常对你怀有某种责任感；如果你付出了巨大努力却失败了，他们会给你喘息的机会。市场则不会如此宽容。客户不在乎你付出了多少汗水，只在乎你是否解决了他们的问题。  
  
投资者评估初创公司的方式与客户评估产品如出一辙，而非上司评价员工那般。如果你正在拼命努力却遭遇失败，他们或许会投资你的下一家初创公司，但绝不会是眼下这个。  
  
然而，从投资者那里融资比向客户销售产品更为艰难，因为投资者数量稀少。这里不存在所谓的有效市场。你很难找到超过10位对你感兴趣的投资者；接触更多人更是难上加难。因此，任何一位投资者的随机行为都可能对你产生实质性影响。  
  
第三个问题：投资者的行为极度不可预测。包括我们在内的所有投资者，在常规标准下都称不上称职。我们经常要对一无所知的事物做出决策，而大多数时候我们都错了。  
  
然而这背后牵涉重大利益。不同类型投资者的投资金额从五千美元到五千万美元不等，但无论哪种类型，这笔钱对他们而言通常都显得数额庞大。投资决策是重大决策。  
  
这种组合——对他们不了解的事物做出重大决策——往往使投资者变得极度反复无常。风险投资家以吊创始人胃口而臭名昭著。其中一些更无原则的人会故意为之。但即便是最善意的投资者，其行为在日常生活中也会显得荒诞不经。某天他们热情高涨，似乎随时准备当场签支票；次日却连你的电话都不接。他们并非在戏耍你。他们只是无法下定决心。[1]  
  
如果这还不够糟糕，这些剧烈波动的节点还全都相互关联。初创企业的投资者彼此熟识，而且（尽管他们不愿承认）他们对你的看法最大程度上取决于其他投资者的意见。[2] 这简直就是制造不稳定的完美配方。你得到的是恐惧/贪婪平衡通常在市场中产生的阻尼效应的反面。没有人会对一家被其他所有人嫌弃的"便宜货"初创公司感兴趣。  
  
因此，参与者稀少的低效市场，又因他们无法完全独立行动而雪上加霜。结果形成了一种系统，就像某种原始的多细胞海洋生物，当你刺激它的一处肢体时，整个生物体会剧烈收缩。  
  
Y Combinator正在努力改变这种状况。我们正试图增加投资者的数量，就像我们增加初创企业的数量一样。我们希望随着双方数量的增长，我们能获得更接近有效市场的状态。当t趋近于无穷大时，演示日就趋近于一场拍卖会。  
  
不幸的是，t距离无穷大仍然非常遥远。在当前这个不完美的世界里，初创公司该如何应对？最重要的是不要让融资打击你的士气。初创公司的生死取决于士气。如果你让融资的困难摧毁了你的士气，这将成为一种自我实现的预言。  
  
**自力更生（=咨询业务）**  
  
一些准创始人此时可能会想，为什么要与投资者打交道？如果融资如此痛苦，为何还要进行？  
  
一个显而易见的答案是：因为你需要钱来维持生活。原则上，用公司自身的收入来资助初创公司是个好主意，但你无法凭空变出客户。无论你创造什么产品，都需要卖出一定数量才能收支平衡。将销售额增长到那个水平需要时间，而在尝试之前很难预测需要多长时间。  
  
例如，我们无法自力更生Viaweb。我们的软件收费相当高——每月每用户约140美元——但至少需要一年时间，我们的收入才能覆盖我们微薄的成本。我们没有足够的积蓄来维持一年的生活。  
  
如果将那些实际上是通过创始人储蓄或日常工作收入来资助的"自力更生"公司排除在外，剩下的公司要么(a)极其幸运（这很难按需实现），要么(b)最初是咨询公司，逐渐转型为产品公司。  
  
咨询是你唯一可以依赖的选择。但咨询绝非免费资金。它可能不像从投资者那里融资那么痛苦，但这种痛苦会分散在更长的时间里。很可能是数年。而对许多类型的初创公司来说，这种延迟可能是致命的。如果你正在开发的东西非常独特，其他人不太可能想到，你可以慢慢来。约书亚·沙克特在华尔街工作期间，逐步建立了Delicious。他之所以能成功，是因为其他人没有意识到这是个好主意。但如果你在Viaweb大约同一时期开发像在线商店软件这样明显必需的产品，并且大部分时间都在做客户工作，只在业余时间开发它，你的处境就不妙了。  
  
自力更生在原则上听起来很棒，但在这片看似繁茂的土地上，很少有初创公司能活着走出来。仅仅因为自力更生的初创公司往往因此而出名这一事实，就应该敲响警钟。如果它真的那么有效，它就会成为常态。[3]  
  
自力更生可能会变得更容易，因为创办公司的成本正在降低。但我认为我们永远不会达到大多数初创公司不需要外部资金的地步。技术成本往往会大幅下降，但生活费用不会。  
  
结果是，你可以选择你的痛苦：要么是融资的短暂而剧烈的痛苦，要么是咨询业务的长期慢性痛苦。对于相同总量的痛苦，融资是更好的选择，因为新技术通常现在比以后更有价值。  
  
尽管对大多数初创公司来说，融资是两害相权取其轻，但它仍然是一个相当大的祸害——大到足以轻易杀死你。不仅仅是在明显的意义上，如果你未能筹集资金，你可能不得不关闭公司，还因为融资过程本身就可能杀死你。  
  
要生存下来，你需要一套与说服投资者所用的技巧基本正交的技术，就像登山者需要知道的生存技巧与物理上上下山所用的技巧基本正交一样。  
  
**1. 保持低期望。**  
  
融资摧毁众多初创公司士气的原因不仅在于它很难，而且在于它比他们预期的要难得多。杀死你的是失望。而你的期望越低，就越难感到失望。  
  
初创公司的创始人往往乐观。这在技术上可能很有效，至少在某些时候是这样，但这是应对融资的错误方式。最好假设投资者总会让你失望。顺便说一句，收购方也是如此。在YC，我们的次要口头禅之一是"交易会失败"。无论你正在进行什么交易，都假设它会失败。这条简单规则的预测能力令人惊讶。  
  
随着交易的进展，会有一种倾向，开始相信它会成功，然后依赖它的成功。你必须抵制这一点。把自己绑在桅杆上。这才是杀死你的东西。交易不像大多数其他人类互动那样具有轨迹，即共同的计划随着时间的推移线性固化。交易往往在最后一刻失败。通常对方直到最后一刻才真正考虑他们想要什么。因此，你不能用你对共同计划的日常直觉作为指导。在交易方面，你必须有意识地关闭这些直觉，变得病态地多疑。  
  
这比听起来更难做到。当著名的投资者似乎对资助你感兴趣时，这非常令人受宠若惊。很容易开始相信融资会快速而直接。但这几乎从未发生过。  
  
**2. 继续推进你的初创公司。**  
  
说你应该在融资的同时继续推进你的初创公司听起来很明显。实际上这很难做到。大多数初创公司都做不到。  
  
融资有一种神秘的能力，能吸走你所有的注意力。即使你每天只与投资者开一次会，不知何故，那一次会议就会耗尽你一整天的时间。它不仅花费了实际会议的时间，还包括往返的时间，以及事先准备和事后思考的时间。  
  
应对与投资者会面分散注意力的最佳方法可能是对公司进行分工：挑选一位创始人负责与投资者打交道，而其他人则继续推进公司业务。这在初创公司有3位创始人时比2位时效果更好，当公司领导者不是主要开发人员时效果也更好。在最好的情况下，公司能以大约一半的速度继续前进。  
  
不过，那是最好的情况。更多情况下，公司在融资期间会陷入停滞。这出于多种原因都非常危险。融资总是比你预期的时间长。看似两周的中断会变成四个月的停滞。这可能非常打击士气。更糟糕的是，这可能让你对投资者失去吸引力。他们希望投资于充满活力的公司。一家四个月内没有任何新进展的公司看起来并不活跃，因此他们开始失去兴趣。投资者很少意识到这一点，但当他们对一家初创公司失去兴趣时，他们很大程度上是在回应自己优柔寡断所造成的损害。  
  
解决方案：将初创公司放在首位。将投资者会议安排在你开发日程的零碎时间，而不是在投资者会议间隙进行开发。如果你能让公司不断前进——发布新功能、增加流量、达成交易、获得媒体报道——那些投资者会议更有可能富有成效。不仅因为你的初创公司看起来更有活力，还因为这更有利于你自己的士气，而士气是投资者评判你的主要标准之一。  
  
**3. 保持保守。**  
  
随着情况恶化，最优策略会变得更加保守。当事情进展顺利时，你可以冒险；当情况糟糕时，你希望稳妥行事。  
  
我建议以融资总是进展不顺的态度来对待融资。原因在于，在你自我欺骗的能力和你所处理的系统极度不稳定的性质之间，事情很可能已经或很容易变得比看起来糟糕得多。  
  
我对我们资助的大多数初创公司的建议是，如果有信誉良好的投资者以合理条件提供资金，就接受它。有些初创公司忽视这一建议并侥幸成功——它们拒绝了一个好报价，希望获得更好的报价，并且确实做到了。但在同样的情况下，我仍会给出同样的建议。谁知道他们玩俄罗斯轮盘赌时枪里装了几颗子弹？  
  
推论：如果一位投资者表现出兴趣，不要让他们干坐着。你不能假设一位有兴趣投资的投资者会保持兴趣。事实上，在你试图将这种兴趣转化为资金之前，你甚至无法判断（他们自己甚至也无法判断）他们是否真的有兴趣。因此，如果你有一个热门目标，要么现在就搞定他们，要么放弃他们。除非你已经获得足够的资金，否则这归结为：现在就搞定他们。  
  
初创公司不是通过获得巨额融资轮次而获胜，而是通过创造出伟大的产品。因此，完成融资并回到工作中去。  
  
**4. 保持灵活。**  
  
风险投资家会问两个你不应该回答的问题："你还在和谁谈？"和"你想筹集多少钱？"  
  
风险投资家并不指望你回答第一个问题。他们只是以防万一才问。[4] 他们似乎确实期望你回答第二个问题。但我认为你不应该直接告诉他们一个数字。这不是为了和他们玩游戏，而是因为你本就不应该有一个固定的融资数额。  
  
初创公司需要固定金额融资的习俗是一个过时的遗留物，源自初创公司成本更高的时代。一家需要建工厂或雇佣50人的公司显然需要筹集一定的最低金额。但如今很少有科技初创公司处于这种境地。  
  
我们建议初创公司告诉投资者，根据筹集金额的不同，他们可以采取几种不同的路径。少至5万美元就能支付创始人一年的食物和房租。几十万美元可以让他们租办公室并雇佣一些从学校认识的聪明人。几百万美元可以让他们真正大展拳脚。传达的信息（不仅是信息，而且是事实）应该是：无论如何我们都会成功。筹集更多资金只是让我们更快实现目标。  
  
如果你正在进行天使轮融资，融资规模甚至可以随时调整。事实上，最好一开始将融资规模定得较小，然后根据需要扩大，而不是试图筹集一大笔钱，冒着因无法筹集全额而失去已有投资者的风险。你甚至可能希望进行"滚动交割"，即融资没有预定规模，而是当投资者同意时，你逐个向他们出售股票。这有助于打破僵局，因为你可以在第一位投资者准备好购买时就开始。[5]  
  
**5. 保持独立。**  
  
一家由二十出头的几位创始人组成的初创公司，其开支可能低至每月2000美元就能盈利。就公司收入而言，这微不足道，但它对你的士气和谈判地位的影响却绝非如此。在YC，我们用"拉面盈利"来形容你赚的钱刚好够支付生活开支的情况。一旦你进入拉面盈利状态，一切都会改变。你可能仍然需要投资来扩大规模，但这个月你不需要它。  
  
在创办初创公司时，你无法计划需要多长时间才能盈利。但如果你发现自己处于只需在销售上稍加努力就能跨越拉面盈利门槛的位置，那就去做。  
  
投资者喜欢你处于拉面盈利状态。这表明你考虑过赚钱，而不仅仅是研究有趣的技术问题；这表明你有纪律保持低开支；但最重要的是，这意味着你不需要他们。  
  
投资者最喜欢的是看起来即使没有他们也能成功的初创公司。投资者喜欢他们能帮助初创公司，但他们不喜欢没有这种帮助就会死亡的初创公司。  
  
在YC，我们花了很多时间试图预测我们资助的初创公司会如何发展，因为我们试图学习如何挑选赢家。我们现在已经观察了如此多初创公司的发展轨迹，以至于我们越来越擅长预测它们。当我们谈论我们认为可能成功的初创公司时，我们发现自己在说"哦，那些人能照顾好自己。他们会没事的"之类的话，而不是"那些人真的很聪明"或"那些人正在研究一个伟大的想法"。[6] 当我们预测初创公司的好结果时，支持论据中出现的品质是坚韧、适应力和决心。这意味着，就我们正确而言，这些就是你获胜所需的品质。  
  
投资者知道这一点，至少是无意识地。他们喜欢你不

[翻译失败 - 原文]> The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about 5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals done in a year. So the odds are against you. You may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc. but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded. 

[翻译失败 - 原文]This is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone. The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new investments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.  
  
In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is, as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups. It's harder to judge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas tend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good but novel. And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seem bad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and it wouldn't be novel.  
  
That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges. You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup investor. That's a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularly imaginative. VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things. [7] Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most were founders themselves.  
  
So when you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, and not what's not. If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing, look at your startup and ask if they're right. If they're real problems, fix them. But don't just take their word for it. You're supposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.  
  
Though a rejection doesn't necessarily tell you anything about your startup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved. Figure out what's not working and change it. Don't just think "investors are stupid." Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose them.  
  
Don't let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap. Sort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking "no one likes us," you'll know precisely how big a problem you have, and what to do about it.  
  
**7\. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).**  
  
Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup. But it's better than dying. It's a bit like anaerobic respiration: not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save you from an immediate threat. If you're having trouble raising money from investors at all, it could save you to be able to shift toward consulting.  
  
This works better for some startups than others. It wouldn't have been a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was making software for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefully into consulting by building sites for clients with it.  
  
So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into consulting, this could even have advantages. You'd understand your users well if you were using the software for them. Plus as a consulting company you might be able to get big-name users using your software that you wouldn't have gotten as a product company.  
  
At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company initially, because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up. But we never charged for such work, because we didn't want them to start treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every time they wanted something changed on their site. We knew we had to stay a product company, because only that scales.  
  
**8\. Avoid inexperienced investors.**  
  
Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most dangerous sort, because they're so nervous. Especially in proportion to the amount they invest. Raising $20,000 from a first-time angel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from a VC fund.  
  
Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too. But while the investors can admit they don't know what they're doing, their lawyers can't. One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with an angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer. And since the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, that he'd screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all the draconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.  
  
Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there would never be any experienced ones. But if you do, either (a) drive the process yourself, including supplying the [paperwork](http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html), or (b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.  
  
**9\. Know where you stand.**  
  
The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness. The worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes after months of meetings. Rejections from investors are like design flaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.  
  
So while you're talking to investors, constantly look for signs of where you stand. How likely are they to offer you a term sheet? What do they have to be convinced of first? You shouldn't necessarily always be asking these questions outright—that could get annoying—but you should always be collecting data about them.  
  
Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push them to. It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of information while making the minimum number of decisions. The best way to force them to act is, of course, competing investors. But you can also apply some force by focusing the discussion: by asking what specific questions they need answered to make up their minds, and then answering them. If you get through several obstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimately they're going to flake.  
  
You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors' intentions. Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine with your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate impressions.  
  
Use the data to weight your strategy. You'll probably be talking to several investors. Focus on the ones that are most likely to say yes. The value of a potential investor is a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and how likely they are to say it. Put the most weight on the second factor. Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply investing. But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor in investors' opinion of you is other investors' opinion of you. If you're talking to several investors and you manage to get one over the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more interested. So you're not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if you focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the best way to convince the lukewarm ones.  
  
**Future**  
  
I'm hopeful things won't always be so awkward. I hope that as startups get cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising money will become, if not easy, at least straightforward.  
  
In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a big opportunity. Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are. They'd be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something that has to be treated as a threat to a company's survival. They just think they need a little more information to make up their minds. They don't get that there are 10 other investors who also want a little more information, and that the process of talking to them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.  
  
Because investors don't understand the cost of dealing with them, they don't realize how much room there is for a potential competitor to undercut them. I know from my own experience how much faster investors could decide, because we've brought our own time down to 20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute interview plus 5 minutes of discussion). If you were investing more money you'd want to take longer, of course. But if we can decide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a couple days?  
  
Opportunities like this don't sit unexploited forever, even in an industry as conservative as venture capital. So either existing investors will start to make up their minds faster, or new investors will emerge who do.  
  
In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous process. Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here. The biggest danger is surprise. It's that startups will underestimate the difficulty of raising money—that they'll cruise through all the initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they'll find it surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up. So I'm telling you in advance: raising money is hard.  
  
  
  
  
  
 **Notes**  
  
[1] When investors can't make up their minds, they sometimes describe it as if it were a property of the startup. "You're too early for us," they sometimes say. But which of them, if they were taken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded, wouldn't offer to invest at any valuation the founders chose? An hour old is not too early if it's the right startup. What "you're too early" really means is "we can't figure out yet whether you'll succeed."  
  
[2] Investors influence one another both directly and indirectly. They influence one another directly through the "buzz" that surrounds a hot startup. But they also influence one another indirectly _through the founders._ When a lot of investors are interested in you, it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more attractive to investors.  
  
No VC will admit they're influenced by buzz. Some genuinely aren't. But there are few who can say they're not influenced by confidence.  
  
[3] One VC who read this essay wrote:  
  
"We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting. It creates very bad behaviors/instincts that are hard to erase from a company's culture."  
  
[4] The optimal way to answer the first question is to say that it would be improper to name names, while simultaneously implying that you're talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to give you term sheets. If you're the sort of person who understands how to do that, go ahead. If not, don't even try. Nothing annoys VCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them.  
  
[5] The disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the valuation is fixed at the start, so if you get a sudden rush of interest, you may have to decide between turning some investors away and selling more of the company than you meant to. That's a good problem to have, however.  
  
[6] I wouldn't say that intelligence doesn't matter in startups. We're only comparing YC startups, who've already made it over a certain threshold.  
  
[7] But not all are. Though most VCs are suits at heart, the most successful ones tend not to be. Oddly enough, the best VCs tend to be the least VC-like.
